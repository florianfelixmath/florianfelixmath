I am interested in the model theory and arithmetic of valued fields and more specifically motivic integration, both in the formalism of Cluckers and Loeser and Hrushovski and Kazhdan. I also like applications of model theory to arithmetic geometry, and applications of arithmetic geometry to model theory (in definability questions for example).
